I'm learning JavaScript and so obviously I've set myself a rather daunting task. Because the simple version would be "too easy" or something. :eyeroll:

The idea is that this will become a choose-your-own-adventure kind of deal, using JS (and jQuery) to navigate the different story blocks. I've done a little just on text editors offline, but I wanted to pull it onto GitHub so I could try different branches, etc.
